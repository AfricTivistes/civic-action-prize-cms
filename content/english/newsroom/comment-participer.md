All you have to do is nominate a person of your choice by filling out the form on the website *[africtivistesprize.com](/)* before July 16, 2021. Your Citizen Champion will have carried out a high-impact, innovative project with a community dynamic.
 

>You have the opportunity to nominate anyone you deem worthy and highlight their work.
 

If you have initiated a project that meets the criteria and you think you might be the champion of civic action we are looking for, you can nominate yourself and/or ask your friends, acquaintances or colleagues to nominate you.
