The competition is open to residents of the 54 African countries aged 40 years or less. Several steps will precede the awarding of the AfricTivistes Civic Action Prize. In that regard, a selection committee will choose the 5 best profiles nominated. The profile of the 5 finalists will be open to public voting on the website. The public's vote will count for 60% of the final decision. The vote of the final jury will count for 40% of the final decision. The finalist with the highest average score of the combined public and final jury votes will be the Winner of the AfricTivistes Civic Action Prize.

The Winner will be announced at the closing dinner of the 3rd AfricTivistes Summit in October 2021 in Nairobi, Kenya.
