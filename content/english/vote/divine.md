description: I Matter Initiative is a youth-led organization (NGO) registered under Rwanda Governance Board (RGB) since 2019, working to end period poverty and stigma attached to menstruation in Rwanda. We strongly believe that women and young girls should not be held back by their periods or lack of information. Our vision is A World where young girls and women are empowered to be active changers of their futures. Our mission is to end period poverty in Rwanda and stigma attached to menstruation and through providing skills in Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) and Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM). Our main actions are through service, advocacy and raising awareness on both online and off-line campaigns. I remain with a drive to help females who are facing issues related to their sexual reproductive health. Knowing how these issues affect their mental health, physical health.Our main project for this year is to focus on students with disabilities and advancing their Sexual Reproductive. This project tailoring learning materials on Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) and Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) for specific disabilities (i.e. translating booklets into braille and having a sign language interpreter handy) and creating awareness on this matter along with period poverty itself.
