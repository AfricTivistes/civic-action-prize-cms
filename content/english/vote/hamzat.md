description: Follow The Money is a Pan-African grassroots movement that tries to answer where funds are coming from, where they're going to but how judiciously these funds are being used to impact grassroots communities. Founded in 2020 by Hamzat Lawal and started in Nigeria as a home-grown initiative, it now evolves in Kenya, The Gambia, Malawi, Cameroon, Zimbabwe, and Liberia. Follow The Money would activate over 8000 active users in the 774 local governments across Nigeria who are members of the Movement to document and track COVID19 interventions by both governments, private sector, and international donors using technology tools. Follow The Money emerged winner of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Mobilizer 2019 Award. This announcement was made at the SDG Global Festival of Action which was held in Bonn, Germany.
