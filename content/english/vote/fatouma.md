description: Psychologist and web journalist This project addresses an action with young people to rebuild their spirit of citizenship, which seems to be lacking lately in Mali. It aims to interest young people in citizenship through citizenship clubs that have been created in secondary schools, but also by working for the involvement of young people in local governance through the realization of a youth charter for democracy and citizenship, but also technical meetings that will take into account the voices of young people for a successful local governance. Group discussions on the themes of citizenship, advocacy and lobbying, democracy and local governance allow young people to get in touch with the current situation in the country and especially to play a role in the process of stabilization of Mali.
