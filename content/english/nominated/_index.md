AfricTivistes is a pan-African organisation created in 2015 that promotes good governance, citizen and civic engagement, democracy, respect for human rights via digital. 

With more than 200 actors of change across 40 countries on the continent, AfricTivistes implements various programmes and projects for Africa. It also uses pedagogy by example to highlight the values of active citizenship, particularly by supporting movements and initiatives of participatory democracy. AfricTivistes trains, encourages, mobilises and accompanies the actors of change while promoting good governance, transparency and the fight against corruption.

AFRICTIVISTES CIVIC ACTION PRIZE is to reward those civic champions who have stood out in the continent for having initiated innovative projects or civic actions that bring change to their respective communities. The first prize will be presented during the 3rd AfricTivistes Summit in November 2021 in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.

This form allows you to nominate any young African, actor of change, whose activities aim to bring well-being to his or her community, regardless of his or her field of activity.
