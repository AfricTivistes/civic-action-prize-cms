description: The Citizen-led tracking initiative is a data-driven social accountability initiative that uses data and leverages digital technology to empower citizens at the grassroots to demand accountability and tracks governments expenditure on social services; health, education, water sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) in grassroots communities to increase and ensure accountability and improve public service delivery at subnational government. Citizen-led tracking Initiative is currently tracking the implementation of the Basic Healthcare Provision Fund in 30 communities in Yobe state, Nigeria and is expected to impact 1200 rural lives and ensure the attainability of universal healthcare coverage. Citizen-led tracking built in a span of 21 months the capacity of over 500 young people and community stakeholders in 60 communities in Nigeria to independently hold the government to account.
