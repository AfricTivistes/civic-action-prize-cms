description: Conserv CONGO is a local Nonprofit with a focus on the fight against the scourge of wildlife trafficking in the DRC and region of central Africa.  Our mission is to preserve the biodiversity of the Congo basin.
Besides chasing after traffickers and bringing them to justice, we:
- Encourage communities to get involved in agroforestry as an option to poaching, but also as a tool to create food security. 
- Educate masses on the importance of applying good environmental ethics in combating climate change.
As the only active organization in central Africa doing field work against wildlife trafficking, we have investigated over 3000 cases of wildlife trafficking, including Trans frontier and cross border trafficking. We have occasioned, with the authorities over 2000 arrests for more than 1500 traffickers, of whom more than 800 have been prosecuted. In the last nine years, we have rescued many live animals:  209 great apes, more than 500 monkeys, crocodiles, tortoises, African grey parrots, pangolins, snakes and birds. All of them are put into various sanctuaries, across the country.
