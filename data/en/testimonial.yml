            "This project aimed to reduce period poverty through sharing adequate information and skills to support marginalised women and girls regardless of where they lived around Nigeria. In 2020 during the International Girl Day, this project impacted over 300 women and girls with free sanitary pads around northern Nigeria. But after our 2020 project report we understand that sanitary pads are not the best solution to end period poverty and financial inequality for women and girls around the world. In 2021, we design a sustainable solution strategy to support these women and girls through reusable pads products. "
