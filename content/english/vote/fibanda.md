description: Wezesha young farmers initiative is an interesting concept that links Environmental conservation, Climate Action to Agriculture using agroecology approach. This initiative is being led by Fibanda at the APSID consulting company. This approach brings good connectivity with nature, and a sustainable way to redesign food systems from the farm to the table. As of now undernourishment and severe food insecurity appears to be increasing in almost all regions in africa. Through Agroforestry, Soil and Water Conservation and Biodiversity Conservation practices increases productivity because the greater diversity on the farm results in greater diversity in plates.
