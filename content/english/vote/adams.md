description: Team Niintche's project is to instill in young people and adults, as well as children, the notion of community engagement through actions that involve them and have a real impact on the daily lives of the population. Thanks to the community service, it provides training in various trades through the renovation of schools and the drilling of wells..... It is also a social incubator for all students, school dropouts and even young social deviants.
