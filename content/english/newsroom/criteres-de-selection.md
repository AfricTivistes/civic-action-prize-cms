The competition is open to residents of the 54 African countries aged 40 years or less. Several steps will precede the organization and the presentation of the AfricTivistes Civic Action Prize. Thus, a pre-selection will be organized at the end of which five profiles will be chosen and put in competition towards the 3rd AfricTivistes Summit in October 2021. They will then be decided by a public vote (60%) combined with the final jury (40%). The announcement of the winners will take place at the closing night of the Summit in Nairobi.
